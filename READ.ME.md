# BDD Framework with Cucumber, Java, and Selenium
  Introduction
This repository contains a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework using Cucumber with Java and Selenium for automating tests of web-based applications. 
BDD encourages collaboration among developers, QA, and stakeholders by defining application behavior in a human-readable format.

  Components
  - Feature Files: Located in src/test/resources/features, feature files are written in Gherkin syntax (.feature files). 
They describe application behavior using scenarios composed of Given-When-Then steps.
  - Step Definitions: Java methods located in src/test/java/stepdefinitions map each step in the feature files to automation code.
Step definitions interpret Given-When-Then steps and perform corresponding actions using Selenium WebDriver APIs.
  - Pages: Pages represent different sections or pages of your web application. They encapsulate the elements and actions specific to each page,
promoting reusability and maintainability in your test automation framework.
  - Test Runner: The test runner class (src/test/java/TestRunner.java) executes feature files and invokes corresponding step definitions.
This class specifies where feature files and step definitions are located.

# Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed.
3. Run tests using the provided test runner (TestRunner.java) or integrate with your CI/CD pipeline.

# Benefits
Collaboration: Stakeholders participate in defining test scenarios.
Readability: Scenarios are written in plain language for clarity.
Reusability: Step definitions can be reused across scenarios.
Integration: Seamless integration with Selenium for web application testing.
Reporting: Detailed test reports provided by Cucumber.
